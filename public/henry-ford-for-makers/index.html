the ones that will be helpful especially to makers — designers, developers, etc.

Simplicity


My effort is in the direction of simplicity.
&hellip;
Because nearly everything that we make is much
more complex than it needs to be.
Our clothing, our food, our household furnishings—all could be
much simpler than they now are and at the same time be better looking.

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>My effort is in the direction of simplicity.
&hellip;
Because nearly everything that we make is much
more complex than it needs to be.
Our clothing, our food, our household furnishings—all could be
much simpler than they now are and at the same time be better looking.</p>

<h2 id="work-money">Work/Money</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking first of money instead of work brings on fear of failure
and this fear blocks every avenue of business—it makes a man afraid
of competition, of changing his methods, or of doing anything which
might change his condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way is clear for any one who thinks first of service—of
doing the work in the best possible way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manufacturing is not buying low and selling high.
It is the process of buying materials fairly and,
with the smallest possible addition of cost,
transforming those materials into a consumable product and giving it
to the consumer.
Gambling, speculating, and sharp dealing, tend only to clog this progression.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="practicality">Practicality</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If you travel the roads in the neighbourhood of Dearborn you can
find all sorts of models of Ford cars.
They are experimental cars—they are not new models.
&hellip;
If an idea seems good or seems even to have possibilities,
I believe in doing whatever is necessary to test out the idea from every angle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Model T&rdquo; had practically no features which were not contained
in some one or other of the previous models.
Every detail had been fully tested in practice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The men often try out little attachments of their own because,
concentrating on one thing, they can, if they have a mind that way,
usually devise some improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of our machines is ever built haphazardly. &hellip;
Sometimes wooden models are constructed or again the parts are drawn
to full size on a blackboard. We are not bound by precedent but we
leave nothing to luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="s-common-knowledge-s"><s>Common Knowledge</s></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>If ever I wanted to kill opposition by unfair means I would endow
the opposition with experts.
They would have so much good advice that I could be sure
they would do little work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where most manufacturers find themselves quicker to make a change
in the product than in the method of manufacturing—we follow
exactly the opposite course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot discover that any one knows enough about anything on this
earth definitely to say what is and what is not possible.</p>
