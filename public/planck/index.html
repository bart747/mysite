        <p>Here are few famous quotes related to <a href="https://bart747.github.io/process/">creative work</a>, by Max Planck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing
its opponents and making them see the light,
but rather because its opponents eventually die,
and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work
of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of
science are written the words: <em>Ye must have faith</em>.
It is a quality which the scientist cannot dispense with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again and again the imaginary plan on which one attempts to build up
that order breaks down and then we must try another.
This imaginative vision and faith in the ultimate success
are indispensable.
The pure rationalist has no place here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New scientific ideas never spring from a communal body,
however organized, but rather from the head of an individually
inspired researcher who struggles with his problems in lonely
thought and unites all his thought on one single point which is
his whole world for the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
