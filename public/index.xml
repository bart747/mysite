      <title>David Lynch on Catching Ideas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;2.5 minutes&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can be surprised by what kind of places will let you catch ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“There&amp;rsquo;s no original ideas, it&amp;rsquo;s just the ideas that you caught”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Happiness in the doing is so important &amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s our life going by”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re in a creative flow ideas are easier to catch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Ideas can take you out of drudgery work”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, just look at these amazing animations and color compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>You need experimentation with freedom. Play to figure things out and get unstuck.
Ideas that you get by doing are more in touch with reality – they are more likely to work.</description>

      <description>Modular Interfaces  Modular UIs are easier to edit in the long run. When your interface is divided into distinct parts, you can also separate chunks of code by following that divisions. Than you can adjust to the real world without tedious redesigns:  You can just swap UI modules in an HTML or template file. You can edit a module in its own file — no need to dig into complex code that’s responsible for many things.</description>

      <title>5 Notes on How to Design a Resilient UI</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/resilient-ui/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting things happen once your software is in real use.
That&amp;rsquo;s when you can really see what&amp;rsquo;s working and what to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It brings us to the problem of editing already working thing. In the wild.
It happens all the time. Don&amp;rsquo;t think you can predict the future.
You need to design your software with ease of modification in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Henry Ford on What Promoted His Cars The Most</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oldie but goodie. Quotes form Henry Ford&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;My Life and Work&lt;/i&gt; on his experiences with advertising/marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;racing&#34;&gt;Racing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed a two-cylinder enclosed engine of a more compact type than I had before used,
fitted it into a skeleton chassis,
found that I could make speed, and arranged a race with Winton.
We met on the Grosse Point track at Detroit.
I beat him. That was my first race, and it brought advertising of the only kind that people cared to read.
The public thought nothing of a car unless it made speed—unless it beat other racing cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>On Lazy Load Overuse and What You Can Do Instead</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/alt-lazy-load/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lazy Load is a great idea, so it&amp;rsquo;s overused frequently.
Do you remember that situation when you scrolled down
quickly to get to the middle part and the picture wasn&amp;rsquo;t there yet?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking at Craftsmen</title>

      <description>I enjoy looking at craftsmen at work. You can learn from it by seeing the process, tricks of the trade, work on details that most people won&amp;rsquo;t even notice. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that it&amp;rsquo;s not my field. It&amp;rsquo;s about that detail-oriented thinking.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are few famous quotes related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bart747.github.io/process/&#34;&gt;creative work&lt;/a&gt;, by Max Planck:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing
its opponents and making them see the light,
but rather because its opponents eventually die,
and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning UI Design from Coins (on Contrast)</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/ui-coins/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bart747.github.io/ui-coins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrast is an essential concept when it comes to UI usability. It solves more problems than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets take coins as an example.
When it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.
Feel in hand is also important. Some seem heavier than others. You can detect size by touch too.
Each of these features is useful in some situation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Payment UIs Can be Used to Reduce Friction</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/payment-ui-friction/</link>

      <guid>https://bart747.github.io/payment-ui-friction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A page with a final &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; button or a credit card data form
is a huge friction trigger.
It&amp;rsquo;s the moment when you, as a buyer, think again about spendings
and transaction safety.
The fact that you&amp;rsquo;re about to say bye to some of your money triggers that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Hint on How to Speed Up Jekyll Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/jekyll-speed/</link>

      <guid>https://bart747.github.io/jekyll-speed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Jekyll site was way too slow recently.
It took around 1 minute per regeneration and much more for starting a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made some improvement by excluding a few files from the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research vs Making Decisions</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/research-decision/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More often than not, research is something that prevents you from making a decision.
You want to be sure, so you seek more.
But your brain is somehow full of doubts all the time, no matter what you know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Henry Ford for Makers: Quotes on Design</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are short excerpts from Henry Ford&amp;rsquo;s “My Life and Work”. I picked
the ones that will be helpful especially to makers&amp;mdash;designers, developers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;simplicity&#34;&gt;Simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My effort is in the direction of simplicity.
&amp;hellip;
Because nearly everything that we make is much
more complex than it needs to be.
Our clothing, our food, our household furnishings—all could be
much simpler than they now are and at the same time be better looking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maintainable UI: How to Improve Code Editing with SASS</title>
      <link>https://bart747.github.io/maintainable-ui/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Changes are unavoidable. And you can’t predict the future.
You also can’t solve problems in theory only, without prototyping.
So make your life easier and build things that are easy to edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of SASS based solutions that you can use to make UI more maintainable and “themable”.&lt;/p&gt;
