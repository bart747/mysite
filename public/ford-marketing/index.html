  <h1 class="article-title">Henry Ford on What Promoted His Cars The Most</h1>
  
  <p>Oldie but goodie. Quotes form Henry Ford&rsquo;s <i>My Life and Work</i> on his experiences with advertising/marketing.</p>

<h2 id="racing">Racing</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I designed a two-cylinder enclosed engine of a more compact type than I had before used,
fitted it into a skeleton chassis,
found that I could make speed, and arranged a race with Winton.
We met on the Grosse Point track at Detroit.
I beat him. That was my first race, and it brought advertising of the only kind that people cared to read.
The public thought nothing of a car unless it made speed—unless it beat other racing cars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;999&rdquo; did what it was intended to do: It advertised the fact that I could build a fast motorcar.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lawsuit">Lawsuit</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The powerful combination of manufacturers who called themselves the &ldquo;licensed manufacturers&rdquo;
because they operated under licenses from the patentee,
brought suit against us as soon as we began to be a factor in motor production.
<br>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>The idea was spread that if the suit finally went against me, every man who owned a Ford car would be prosecuted.
<br>[&#8230;]</p>

<p>We thought that the bond would give assurance to the buyers—that they needed confidence.
They did not.
We sold more than eighteen thousand cars—nearly double the output of the previous year—and
I think about fifty buyers asked for bonds—perhaps it was less than that.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, probably nothing so well advertised the Ford car and the
Ford Motor Company as did this suit.
It appeared that we were the under dog and we had the public&rsquo;s sympathy.</p>
</blockquote>
