        <p>Living in a bubble, the one that&rsquo;s unavoidable, makes us misjudge what are
the most complex things we have to face.
We think that some technical (software/hardware) problems are
the most convoluted ones, but actually, everyday things like traffic or sales are way more complex.</p>

<p>If you deal with software development, you have to be more analytical about dependencies and scale than sales people or taxi drivers. But you&rsquo;re not in more convoluted environment. It&rsquo;s just a difference in awareness.</p>

<p>A salesman knows that he can select and call ten
different prospects and get “no” from nine of them. He will keep trying. He will
adjust the course (build new heuristics) every time he notices a pattern.
However, he will never figure
out a theory that universally explains what makes people buy, so that he
can predict decisions, or call only those who will almost for sure say “yes”.
And this is OK — he will do well anyway.
People like him don&rsquo;t bother to do much calculation or predictions.
They just progressively iterate, tinker, observe and judge.
And they accept that they will never know everything.</p>

<p>Just because your environment is complicated doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to
understand all its aspects to get by.
It&rsquo;s about iteration and couple of good heuristics — not predictiveness.
On the other hand, learning something commonly known as
hard and complicated doesn&rsquo;t mean that your abilities to predict the future are now greater.
In the big picture it&rsquo;s just a bird shit.</p>
