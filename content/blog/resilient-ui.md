## Modularity

The most interesting things happen once your software is in real use.
That's when you can really see what's working and what to change.
It brings us to the importance of modularity.

Modular UIs are easier to edit in the long run.
When your interface is divided into distinct parts, you can also separate chunks of code by following that divisions.
Than you can adjust to the real world without tedious redesigns:

1. You can just swap UI modules in an HTML or template file.
2. You can edit a module in its own file &mdash; no need to dig into complex code that's responsible for many things.


## Embrace Foundations

If I need to pick between working on something essential or adding bells and whistles, I pick essentials.
It's just hard to be really good at all of them, so why even focus on *nice to haves*?

Working extra on things like clarity (intuitiveness, readability) and speed
will give you more than any neophiliac thing.
   

## Simplicity is Tricky

It's easy to achieve perceived simplicity and pay for it with real complexity.
For instance, you can make an intuitive UI while ignoring clarity of its implementation.
Sooner or later it will cause all kinds of unexpected problems.

Real simplicity of an interface means neat visuals AND clear implementation.
To achieve that, you often need to sacrifice some non-crucial features.

     
## Smooth Interactions
    
There's an overwhelming variety of internet browsing devices on the market.
We need to think about what will make the product work smoothly on a sub-average hardware and half-decent wi-fi.
People will often use your stuff at train stations, airports and in restaurants.
 

## Words Win
    
People say “a picture is like a thousand words”.
But a picture will not make a proposition as clear and precise as a well designed sentence.
That's why I like typography. 
Good typography is a tool to achieve clarity.
