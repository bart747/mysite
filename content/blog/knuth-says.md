title: "Old Programming Wisdom Beats Crowdsourced Advice"

There's so many hypes and trends in “how you should do programming” discourse.
In the past we had “new best practices” that turned out ot be disappointment.
We also had ideas that worked well only with some problems, but many people
started promoting them as “the new universal way”. Programmers as a crowd, like any crowd, are fucking dumb.
This is why I like to look for advice by turning to individuals who achieved something worth admiring and 
show signs of being independent thinkers.

Couple times I made a mistake of clicking on a link that led to Quora thread on some software problem. I knew what to expect but they figured out how to irritate me anyway. It's interesting how StackOverflow somehow avoids turning into this kind of clusterfuck. You still have to be suspicious and don't treat that voting system too seriously, but it's useful. I'm used to think that something that helps in groupthink, like forums and comment threads, has to be a waste of time. StackOverflow surprised me. But it's an exception.

Here's a couple of quotes of people that did something right and we can learn from:

## Donald Knuth

From an [interview at InformIT](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856)):

> I must confess to a strong bias against the fashion for reusable code. To me, "re-editable code" is much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit. I could go on and on about this. If you’re totally convinced that reusable code is wonderful, I probably won’t be able to sway you anyway, but you’ll never convince me that reusable code isn’t mostly a menace.
