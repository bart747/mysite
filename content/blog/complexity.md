Living in a bubble,  the one that's unavoidable, makes us misjudge what are
the most complex things we have to face.
We think that, for instance, some technical (software/hardware) problems are
the most convoluted ones.
Actually, everyday things like traffic or sales are way more complex.

If you solve software problems you might think that you have to deal with bigger complexity
than a salesman or a taxi driver. That's wrong. You just have to think more analytical about it.
Your level of awareness is higher, but you're not dealing with more convoluted surroundings.

A salesman knows that he can select and call ten
different prospects and hear “no” nine times in a row. He will keep trying. He will
adjust the course (build new heuristics) every time he notice a pattern.
However, he will never figure
out a theory that universally explains what makes people buy, so that he
can predict decisions, or call only those who will almost for sure say “yes”.
And this is OK – he will do well anyway.
People like him don't bother to do much calculation or predictions.
They just iterate, tinker, observe and judge, accepting that they will
never know everything.

We never know all aspects of a given real life problem, and somehow we figure out the way.
It's never perfect, but it's good enough to keep going.
It's about iteration and couple of good heuristics – not predictiveness.
