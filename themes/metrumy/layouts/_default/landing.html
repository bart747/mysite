    Hi, this is how I work.

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Modular, Easy to Test and Rearrange</h2>

      <p class="">
        All patterns like a headline, a call to action button or a gallery
        are in a form of modules that can be rearranged.
        They look good in any order.
        No need need to write additional code to change a page structure.

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Just What's Needed</h2>

      <p class="">
        Everything is based on familiar, battle-tested UI patterns.
        No fancy animations and illustrations that don't do anything except looking cool.
        Layouts are simple and proven – nothing new.
        Fancy layouts lower usability (by being less familiar) and make responsive design hard (by adding variability).

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Typography</h2>

      <p class="">
      People say “a picture is like a thousand words”, but very often it's a very vague way of presenting information. 
      When you need to be precise, well design phrases and clean text are the key. That's why I like typography.

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Vanilla JavaScript</h2>

      <p class="">
        Scripts are small and to the purpose. I use pure functions a lot. I don't like inheritance.
        Things are kept in high composability – like a simple code library.
        It helps in testing different ideas without a lot of code editing.
