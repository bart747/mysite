    Hi, this is how I work.

      <p class="">
        All patterns like a headline, a call to action button or a gallery
        are in a form of modules that can be rearranged.
        They look good in any order.
        No need need to write additional code to change a page structure.

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Just What's Needed</h2>

      <p class="">
        Strong focus on essentials.
        No fancy animations and illustrations that don't do anything except looking cool.
        Fancy layouts lower usability (by being less familiar) and make responsive design hard (by adding variability).

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Typography</h2>

      <p class="">
      People say “a picture is like a thousand words”, but very often it's a very vague way of presenting information. 
      When you need to be precise, well design phrases and clean text are the key. That's why I like typography.

      <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Vanilla JavaScript</h2>

      <p class="">
        Scripts are small and to the purpose. I use pure functions a lot. I don't like inheritance.
        Things are kept in high composability – like a simple code library.
        It helps in testing different ideas without a lot of code editing.
