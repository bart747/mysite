    Hi, this is how I work.
    It's about <span class="work--highlight-2">coding</span> to <span class="work--highlight-2">sell</span>.</h1>
  
  <p class="p--big">
    There are many factors that make a product page design sell better.
    But there's only a few that repetitively give big impact.

  <section class="work--miniarticle">

    <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Smart image loading</h2>

    <p class="">
      On the beginning only the most important pictures are being downloaded. That way they will show up faster.
      Less important (below the fold) ones are waiting (max. 2 sec.) for their turn without using bandwidth.

  <section class="work--miniarticle">

    <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Vanilla JavaScript</h2>

    <p class="">
      Scripts are small and to the purpose. I like pure functions. I don't like inheritance.
      It doesn't mean I'm about purely functional programming. Mutable state can be useful.

  <section class="work--miniarticle">

    <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Modular, Easy to Test and Rearrange</h2>

    <p class="">
      All patterns like a headline, a call to action button or a gallery
      are in a form of modules that can be rearranged.
      They look good in any order.
      No need need to write additional code to change a page structure.

  <section class="work--miniarticle">

    <h2 class="work--miniarticle--title">Just what's needed</h2>

    <p class="">
      Everything is based on familiar, battle-tested UI patterns.
      No fancy animations and illustrations that don't do anything except looking cool.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Layouts are simple and proven â€“ nothing new.
      Fancy layouts lower usability (by being less familiar) and make responsive design hard (by adding variability).
